# `fatnum` - A C++ framework for arbitrary precision arithmetic

`fatnum` is a C++ framework for arbitrary precision arithmetic. **This is a WIP project and is not yet ready for production use.**

## Features (ToDo list)

- [ ] Big integers declaration, initialization, and serialization
- [ ] Display of big integers
- [ ] Ordering and comparison of big integers
- [ ] Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) for big integers : Implementation of the Karatsuba and Sch√∂nhage-Strassen algorithms for multiplication
- [ ] Modular arithmetic
- [ ] Parallelism with OpenMP and MPI + GPU acceleration with CUDA
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite
