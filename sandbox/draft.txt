- Create a datastructure with fast access time and minimal memory footprint to store large (>1000 digits) numbers. It should implement mechanisms to optimize the storage on the file and be easily used in arithmetic operations.
- The datastructure should contain the following fields :
    - sign (bool) 1 = positive, 0 = negative
    - value (abs(num)), digits of the number stored in a memory and time efficient manner
    - length (int)
    - chunksize (depending on solution)

# -----------------------------------------------
- C or C++ ? if in C++, requires a wrapper to be called from C !!
- Load big numbers from files, directly in a program (as strings or int)
- be compatible with native integers types in C/C++
- be memory friendly = not a memory hog
- target Unix* system first and later windows
